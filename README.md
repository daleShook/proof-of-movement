# proof-of-movement

## Purpose
This repo is part of a focused effort to consolidate and show forward movement in AI learning and systems work. It's not a portfolio, it's a process log. The goal is to document artifacts that reflect skill growth, discipline, and applied understanding.

## What's Included
- **Week 1 - Python Assessment Rebuild:** A re-creation and simulation of elements from a technical Python assessment, including commentary and related exercises.
- **Week 2 - Mini Project Placeholder:** Early-stage exploration of an AI pipeline or tooling integration (e.g., LangChain, Vector DB, or prompt workflow).

## What's Next
Each week builds on the last. This is where visible progress lives. Real deliverables. More coming.
